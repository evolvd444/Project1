## Summary
![Screenshot of Game](Kill Van Damme.png)

This game is designed as a Shooter aka clicker. 
I imagined a whack a mole type game but with a bow and arrow orginally. but as the project went on it evolved into something a little different. i decided to use van damme as the target and imagine he was an evil doppleganger from another universe. Anyway I used a for loop to clear the board and a couple randoms code to make the Hostages and vandamme appear in random places.

## Rules of the Game
Van Damme before he kills you.
- You will take damage if you miss -10 hp
- He will take damage if you shoot him before he turns
- You can click multiple times but becareful if you click while he is still turning it will count as a miss and you will lose points.
- If you shoot a hostage you will lose -10 hp
- If van Dammes health goes to zero before yours you win. if not you lose.
- Have fun
